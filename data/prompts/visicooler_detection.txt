You are analyzing a single image to determine whether a VISICOOLER (glass-door beverage refrigerator) is present.

Output only one of:

{"1001":"Y"} — a real visicooler is clearly present.
{"1001":"N"} — no visicooler is present.
{"1001":"PARTIAL"} — a visicooler is partly visible, but not fully confirmable.

Strict Rule:
- If 1001 = "N" or "PARTIAL", then all keys 1002–1011 in visicooler_parameters MUST be "N/A".

Definition — What counts as a Visicooler

A real, functional beverage fridge that typically:

has transparent glass door(s) or top,

shows multiple shelves inside,

contains beverage inventory (bottles/cans clearly visible),

shows cooling evidence (any of: interior LED glow, condensation/frosting on glass/evaporator edges, uniformly cold look of bottles/cans, light reflections typical of lit interiors),

appears in a retail / food-service context (shop, counter area, aisle, café, bar, kiosk, back-bar).

All criteria above must be visibly satisfied to return "Y".

Positive Cues (supporting "Y")

Glass door(s) with visible shelf rails and stocked beverages.

Interior lighting on; recognizable reflections from LED strips.

Beverage facings (labels facing outward, multiple same-SKU rows).

Visible door handle and gasket; hinged/pivoting glass door.

Located near counter/POS, in an aisle, or back-bar.

Negative / Exclusion Cues (force "N")

Opaque/solid doors (no visibility of contents).

Chest freezers, ice-cream freezers, open islands, or top-open coolers with sliding glass without vertical shelving for beverages.

Open shelves with drinks but no cooling enclosure.

Posters, printed ads, stickers, menus, artworks depicting coolers — flat 2D visuals.

Mini-bar/domestic fridges without visible shelves/beverage merchandising.

Image too blurry/partial to verify shelves + contents + enclosure → "N" (do not guess).

Ambiguity Rule

If any required component cannot be verified (e.g., shelves not visible, contents unclear, door not clearly glass), output "1001":"N".

Output only the JSON object.

Analyze the image and determine if a visicooler is present. Return a JSON object with: classid 1001 ('Y' if a visicooler is present, 'N' if not), classid 1002 (brand of visicooler: 'Coca-Cola', 'PepsiCo', 'Unbranded', or 'None' if no visicooler is present).
