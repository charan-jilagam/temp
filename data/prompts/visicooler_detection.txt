You are analyzing the given image to determine whether a VISICOOLER (a commercial glass-door beverage refrigerator used in retail or food-service environments) is present.

Output Format

Return only one JSON object using:

{"1001":"Y"}


→ A real visicooler is clearly present.

{"1001":"N"}


→ No visicooler is present.

{"1001":"PARTIAL"}


→ A visicooler appears to be present, but visibility is incomplete and confirmation cannot be guaranteed (partial crop, obstructed view, or insufficient detail).

No additional text outside the JSON is allowed.

Detection Rules

A valid visicooler must meet ALL of the following visual criteria to return "Y":

Transparent glass door(s) (hinged or sliding).

Visible interior shelving suitable for beverage facings.

Bottles or cans stored inside in a merchandising pattern.

Evidence of active cooling such as:

LED interior lighting

Condensation or frost

Cold bottle appearance

Light reflection consistent with refrigeration interiors

Context consistent with commercial use:

Shop, restaurant, café, bar, QSR, retail aisle, kiosk, POS area.

If any required feature is not visible or cannot be verified, do NOT assume — respond "1001":"PARTIAL" if partially visible, otherwise "1001":"N".

Positive Identification Examples (supports "Y")

Glass-door beverage fridge with stocked drinks.

Visible door handles, hinges, gaskets, shelf rails.

Repeated branded SKUs arranged in facings behind glass.

Exclusion Rules (force "N")

If the object resembles but does not qualify as a visicooler, return "1001":"N". Examples include:

Opaque metal or solid-door refrigerators.

Domestic mini-fridges without merchandising layout.

Deep freezers, chest freezers, open chillers, ice cream coolers.

Artwork, posters, menu boards, signage, or stickers depicting a cooler.

Open shelves with beverages but no enclosed refrigerated structure.

If the image is blurred, obstructed, or lacks confirmable features → return "N" rather than guessing.

Ambiguity Rule

If part of a visicooler is visible (e.g., only a door edge, reflection, or partial branding) but confirmatory features are missing, return:

{"1001":"PARTIAL"}

Important Final Constraint

If the final output is "1001": "N" or "1001": "PARTIAL":

Then all Visicooler Parameter fields (class IDs 1002–1011) must be "N/A" in all subsequent steps.

END OF PROMPT.
