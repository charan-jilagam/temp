You are analyzing an image that already contains a visicooler. Return only a JSON object with exact keys 1002–1011. No extra text.

Output Contract:
Return all keys 1002–1011:
{"1002":"…","1004":"…", ... ,"1011":"…"}

Global Rules:
- If 1001 is "N" or "PARTIAL", then all 1002–1011 MUST be "N/A".
- If the visicooler brand (1002) is not "Coca-Cola", then 1004–1011 must also be "N/A".
- Use "Partial" exactly for 1007 when only part of a Coca-Cola visicooler is visible.
If something is not clearly visible/confirmable → use "N/A" (or "Unknown" only where specified).

Use precise text cues and logos. Do not rely on color alone unless the distinctive Coca-Cola/Pepsi marks are visibly present.

Field Definitions & Decision Rules

1002 — Visicooler Brand
Allowed values: "Coca-Cola", "Pepsi", "Unbranded", "Unknown".

"Coca-Cola": visible Coca-Cola script logo, bottle/can with clear Coke mark, branded crown/topper/side-panel, red + white wave with readable mark.

"Pepsi": visible Pepsi text/logo (red-white-blue globe) on crown/side/topper/door decal.

"Unbranded": no brand graphics; plain/neutral styling; no readable brand text.

"Unknown": branding present but too small/blurry/occluded to read.

When in doubt between Unbranded vs Unknown:

If you see graphics but cannot read → "Unknown".

If there are no graphics at all → "Unbranded".

If 1002 ≠ "Coca-Cola", set 1004–1011 = "N/A" and stop.

1004 — Coca-Cola Visicooler Working (Y/N/N/A)

"Y" if any cooling evidence: interior lights on, condensation, uniformly cold “sweat” on bottles, frost on evaporator edges, running fan patterns behind grilles.

"N" if clearly off: dark interior (while surroundings are well-lit), unplugged with door ajar and no cold signs, empty/damaged with no cooling cues.

"N/A" if 1002 ≠ "Coca-Cola" or cannot assess.

1005 — Coca-Cola Visicooler Pics Allowed (Y/N/N/A)

"N" if a prohibition sign (“No Photos/No Camera”) is clearly visible near/onto the cooler/area.

"Y" if no such sign in view (do not infer policy).

"N/A" if 1002 ≠ "Coca-Cola"` or sign visibility cannot be determined.

1006 — Coca-Cola Visicooler Visibility From Street (Y/N/N/A)

"Y" if cooler is clearly visible from outside (e.g., through shop window/door line-of-sight).

"N" if it’s deep inside / blocked such that a passerby from street couldn’t see it.

"N/A" if no exterior/window context is visible or 1002 ≠ "Coca-Cola"`.

1007 — Coca-Cola Visicooler Visibility In Shop (Fully/Partial/Not visible/N/A)

"Fully": unobstructed and prominent (entire door area seen).

"Partial": partly blocked (racks/people/objects obscure meaningful portion).

"Not visible": cannot locate within interior context.

"N/A" if 1002 ≠ "Coca-Cola"`.

1008 — Coca-Cola Visicooler Accessible (Y/N/N/A)

"Y": appears reachable to customers (front-of-house, no “Staff Only” barrier, no visible locks/chains).

"N": behind counter/rope barrier, locked chain/visible lock label, or “Staff Only.”

"N/A" if 1002 ≠ "Coca-Cola"` or unclear.

1009 — Coca-Cola Brand Shelf Strip (Y/N/N/A)

"Y": Coca-Cola shelf edge branding (red strips with Coca-Cola marks) on the cooler’s shelves or immediate rack area.

"N": shelves visible but no Coca-Cola shelf strips.

"N/A": cannot see shelf edges clearly or 1002 ≠ "Coca-Cola"`.

1010 — Coca-Cola Planogram Compliance (Y/N/N/A)

"Y": products arranged per typical Coca-Cola planogram (clear vertical/horizontal blocks, consistent SKU rows, no major mixing).

"N": chaotic mix, non-Coke brands interspersed, significant deviation.

"N/A": contents not visible/assessable or 1002 ≠ "Coca-Cola"`.

1011 — Coca-Cola Cooler Purity (100% pure/Impure/N/A)

"100% pure": contents entirely Coca-Cola company products (e.g., Coke, Sprite, Fanta, Thums Up, etc.), with no other brand present.

"Impure": any non-Coca-Cola brand observed inside.

"N/A": contents unclear or 1002 ≠ "Coca-Cola"`.

Return only the JSON object with 1002–1011.
